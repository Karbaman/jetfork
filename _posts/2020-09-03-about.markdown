Hi, my name is Petr and I'm a Team lead and software developer (iOS, front-end). I work for an international IT company in Gdansk, Poland. In my spare time I create games for my kids and experiment with augmented reality and artificial intelligence for mobile applications. Check out my [CV][cv] for more details.
