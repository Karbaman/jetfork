Some time ago I published 2 iOS educational games for children using Swift and SpriteKit:

- Easy kids education:
  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-kids-education/id1312442451" target="_blank">[App store]</a>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/NAUKOzahdFQ" target="_blank">[Gameplay video 1]</a>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/-XQcTq7REj0" target="_blank">[Gameplay video 2]</a>
- Easy math learning:
  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-math-learning/id1332434011" target="_blank">[App store]</a>

These games were made for my daughter and they are free starting today.
